    <summary>Automatically resume playback even after abrupt shutdown.</summary>
    <description>This service will automatically resume playback when XBMC starts. Even if the media was never stopped and XBMC was not shutdown (i.e. power was cut).
    This is a forked version based on the service.autoResume addon developed by gatorfreak.
    The main change is supporting resuming the next media file in the directory, using natural sorting for directory listing.
